## Who am I?

I'm Echo, a sixth form student studying Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics. I'm an avid programmer and have written many little tools and toys for the computer, and some of them even work! I primarily use C# and WPF, although I started out on VB.NET years ago.

## What have I worked on?

I've worked on Trigger Fixer, a browser extension to replace certain words for people who need that. I'm writing a C# library with some friends called BinaryFuncs with over 100 downloads, which is some basic functions on various types of binary, as well as providing an interface for people to easily create and edit these binary numbers in various different forms.

## What next?

I'm planning on studying Software Engineering at university, with the end goal of getting a job in the industry.
